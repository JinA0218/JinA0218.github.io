Hi!👋 
I'm an **undergraduate student** at KAIST, **majoring [CS](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/)** and **minoring [BCS](https://bcs.kaist.ac.kr/)**.  

I love **mathematics**, **neuroscience**, and especially **artificial intelligence**.

I've been working as a **research intern** at [KAIST MLAI](https://www.mlai-kaist.com/) (advisor: [Prof. Sung Ju Hwang](http://www.sungjuhwang.com/)) **since 2022 Fall**.


✨ My current **research interest** lies in
- <span >**Model Merging**</span>
- <span >**Efficient Transformer**</span>
- <span >**Interpretable AI (Brain inspired AI)**</span>


🌱 I lived in US(New York), Hong Kong, South Korea(Seoul, Daejeon) and I love building connections with people from diverse backgrounds. Happy to connect!😊
