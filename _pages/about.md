Hi!👋 
I'm an undergraduate student at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), majoring [CS](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) and minoring [BCS](https://bcs.kaist.ac.kr/).  I love mathematics, neuroscience, and especially artificial intelligence.
I'm working as a research intern at [KAIST MLAI](https://www.mlai-kaist.com/) (advisor: [Prof. Sung Ju Hwang](http://www.sungjuhwang.com/)), since 2022 Fall.

✨ My current research interest lies in
- <span >**Model Merging**</span>
- <span >**Efficient Transformer**</span>
- <span >**Interpretable AI (Brain inspired AI)**</span>

🌱 I was born in New York, raised in Hong Kong(5 years) and South Korea. I love building connections with people from diverse backgrounds 😊 Happy to connect!
